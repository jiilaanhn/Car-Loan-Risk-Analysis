# Car-Loan-Risk-Analysis

A company provides car-backed loans to dealers, where the loan amount is determined based on the vehicle's value. In the first half of 2024, the pricing team adjusted financing amounts for three car types. These adjustments influenced the number of loan transactions and default rates. The objective is to identify the optimal financing amount that maximizes total margin while maintaining a balance between risk and profitability. Analyzing historical loan performance enables the identification of patterns in profitability and risk, providing insights for optimal pricing decisions.
